# Minimax visualizer
An intuitive minimax decision tree visualization tool on the games of TicTacToe and Connect4.

## Outlining the stages
1. (Completed) Build a TicTacToe game and a computer player with a minimax algorithm. (Done. Credits to [Kylie Ying](https://github.com/kying18/tic-tac-toe)
2. (Completed) Build a Connect4 game and a computer player with minimax algorithm. (Done. However, it takes too long to make a decision due to the exponential increase in number of possible outcomes.)
3. (In progress) Build a python GUI using tkinter to visualize the possible next moves the computer sees and the respective scores for each move.
4. (In progress) Implement alpha-beta pruning algorithm.
5. (To Do) Consider Deep Reinforcement Learning for [Connect4](https://codebox.net/pages/connect4) and pit both algorithms against each other. (excites!)
6. (To Do) Consider using a web-based application for easier accessibility.
